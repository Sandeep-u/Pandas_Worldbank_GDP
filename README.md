# World bank GDP analysis for central and eastern Europe in Pandas 

Project analysys the GDP (Gross domestic product) for 10 central and eastern European countries:

* Poland
* Germany
* Belarus
* Czech Republic
* Slovak Republic
* Hungary
* Estonia
* France
* Ukraine

All the analysis was done with use of [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) and [seaborn](http://seaborn.pydata.org/) library. 
The data come from the World Bank [World Development Indicatiors](http://databank.worldbank.org/data/reports.aspx?source=world-development-indicators). 

## Project Goal

The goal is to answer the question: 

**How far in economic develpment eastern Europe conoutries are relative to developed countries like Germany and France?**

We try to do it with a few visualization in seaborn and pandas. 

## What will you learn? 

This project will teach you: 

* How to read cvs files in Pandas Data Frame
* How to clean the data, remove missing values, remove unnecessary columns etc.
* How to create pivot table in Pandas
* How to create plots in seaborn based on pandas data frame
* How to create regression plots

## Files

* GDP_Eastern_Europe.csv - data file, generated from World Bank Development Indicators
* gdp_pandas_woldbank.py - main file with analysis
* Gdp_regression.py - visualise the regresion plots



The project was described in a blog entry(in polish)
