# World bank GDP analysis for central and eastern Europe in Pandas 

Project analysys the GDP (Gross domestic product) for 10 central and eastern European countries:

* Poland
* Germany
* Belarus
* Czech Republic
* Slovak Republic
* Hungary
* Estonia
* France
* Ukraine

All the analysis was done with use of [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) and [seaborn](http://seaborn.pydata.org/) library. 
The data come from the World Bank [World Development Indicatiors](http://databank.worldbank.org/data/reports.aspx?source=world-development-indicators). 

## Project Goal

The goal is to answer the question: 

**How far in economic development eastern Europe countries are relative to developed countries like Germany and France?**

To answer this question we will analyze four GDP factors:

* GDP per capita ( US$)
* GDO per capita growth (annual %)
* GDP growth (annual %)
* GDP (current US$)

We visualize all indicators with seaborn and pandas matplotlib plots. Sample plot:

## What will you learn? 

This project will teach you: 

* How to read cvs files into Pandas Data Frame
* How to clean the data, remove missing values, remove unnecessary columns, convert dates etc.
* How to create pivot table in Pandas
* How to create plots based on pandas data frame
* How to create regression plots in seaborn (sns.lmplot)
* How to create bar plot witch stacked collumns
